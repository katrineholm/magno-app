# Magno Platform

This platform is part of our (Katrine Norheim Holm and Vår Sørensen Sæbøe-Larssen) master's thesis. It allows administration and testing of students using a motion detection test and two variations of a form detection test for use in dyslexia research. The platform is based on the following master theses:

* [Bjørnar Wold's App for Early Detection of Dyslexia](https://ntnuopen.ntnu.no/ntnu-xmlui/handle/11250/2421182)
* [Thea Hove Johansen and Maja Kirkerød's Magno: An Application for Detection of Dyslexia - Dyslexia and Interface Design](https://ntnuopen.ntnu.no/ntnu-xmlui/handle/11250/2454100)
* [Tore Angell Petersen's An Application for Detection of Dyslexia](https://ntnuopen.ntnu.no/ntnu-xmlui/handle/11250/2557938)
* [Fredrik Jenssen's Magno: An Application for Detection of Dyslexia](https://ntnuopen.ntnu.no/ntnu-xmlui/handle/11250/2826619)
* [Jack Minsoo Hurum Syvertsen's Magno: A platform for Dyslexia screening](https://ntnuopen.ntnu.no/ntnu-xmlui/handle/11250/3032263)

The repository for the platform and server is available at the following URL https://github.com/katrineholm/magno-app

The repository for the updated tests is available at https://github.com/katrineholm/magno-test

The deployed version can be found at https://magno-app-2023.ew.r.appspot.com/home 

## Usage
**Dependencies**

To run the application you need Node.js and npm installed. After cloning the project, simply run npm install within the directory to install all project dependencies. Afterwards, open a second command line window, and change directory the the server directory and run npm install again to install the server dependencies.

The project uses the following packages:

* [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
* [Express](https://expressjs.com/)
* [Crypto-js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/crypto-js)
* [MaterialUI](https://mui.com/)
* [Mobx](https://mobx.js.org/README.html)
* [Recharts](https://recharts.org/)
* [uuid](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-uuid)
* [@azure/cosmos](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@azure/cosmos)
* [universal-cookie-express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/universal-cookie-express)


**Development build**
With dependencies installed, you need to have two command line interfaces open. One pointing to the platform directory, and one pointing to the server directory. To run the platform and server, enter the following command in both CLIs. 

```
npm start
```

The website is hosted at localhost:3000.

**Production build**
To start the build procedure for the platform, run

```
npm run build
```

**Deployment**
If you have not done so already, you should create a production build of the platform. The files from the production build will be located within magno-platform\build, copy all these files into the magno-platform\server\public folder before deployment.

To deploy the platform for the first time, create a user at [Heroku](https://dashboard.heroku.com/new-app) and create a new app, choose a fitting name and region. 
After this is done, you need to initiate a new git repository in the server folder, you can follow the instructions given under Deploy using Heroku Git on the page you are redirected to after creating the Heroku App.

Install the Heroku CLI
Download and install the [Heroku CLI](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-command-line).

If you haven't already, log in to your Heroku account and follow the prompts to create a new SSH public key.

```
heroku login
```

Create a new Git repository
Initialize a git repository in a new or existing directory

```
cd magno-platform/server
git init
heroku git:remote -a name-of-your-app-as-set-on-heroku
```

Deploy your application
Commit your code to the repository and deploy it to Heroku using Git.

```
git add .
git commit -am "make it better"
git push heroku master
```



## Integrating new tests

**Back-end**

There are a few steps to integrating new tests

* Build the test, you should end up with a combination of an index.html file, and JavaScript and css files which are usually located in a static folder.
* Navigate to the magno-platform/server/public/tests folder, and create a new folder with a fitting name for your test. Copy the HTML file into this folder.
* Copy the remaining JavaScript and css files directly into the magno-platform/server/public folder

Now for the coding parts of integration.

**

In the magno-platform/server/server.js file you need to add a route to your test, an example is given below of how this is performed.
This is with the HTML file for motion test being located in the magno-platform/server/public/tests/motion folder.

```
const motion_dir = `${__dirname}/public/tests/motion/`;

app.get('/motion', (req, res) => {
  res.sendFile(motion_dir + "index.html", {dotfiles: "allow"});
})
```

An example of how your code might look, replace REPLACE_WITH_NAME_OF_FOLDER with the name you have set for your test folder. Replace REPLACE_WITH_DESIRED_URL_ENDPOINT with your desired url endpoint, as an example,
if this was set to /motion, the url would end up as https://magno-test.herokuapp.com/motion

```
const motion_dir = `${__dirname}/public/tests/REPLACE_WITH_NAME_OF_FOLDER/`;

app.get('/REPLACE_WITH_DESIRED_URL_ENDPOINT', (req, res) => {
  res.sendFile(motion_dir + "index.html", {dotfiles: "allow"});
})
```

**Front-end**

There are a few steps necessary to integrate the test properly with the front-end, e.g. being able to initiate the test from the front-end, and seeing the results in the Student screen.

First you need an image that represents your test, and shows what it looks like, afterwards you need to add this image to the following folder magno-platform/src/files.

Afterwards, open Tests.tsx which is located in magno-platform/src/components/views. Here you will need to add an ActionTestCard, which looks like the following.

```
<ActionTestCard 
    header={props.translation.tests.headerMotion} 
    link={"motion"}
    tooltip={props.translation.tests.tooltip}
    text={props.translation.tests.textMotion} 
    img={MotionDots}
    handleTestClick={openDialog}
    buttonText={props.translation.tests.buttonText}>
</ActionTestCard>
```

For your test it would look like this, where you again replace some text, namely NAME_OF_YOUR_TEST. In addition, you need to import the image you moved into the files folder. You do this at the top of the same file, Tests.tsx

```
import ImageOfTest from '../../files/ImageOfTest.jpg';
```

```
<ActionTestCard 
    header={props.translation.tests.headerNAME_OF_YOUR_TEST} 
    link={"REPLACE_WITH_DESIRED_URL_ENDPOINT"}
    tooltip={props.translation.tests.tooltip}
    text={props.translation.tests.textNAME_OF_YOUR_TEST} 
    img={ImageOfTest}
    handleTestClick={openDialog}
    buttonText={props.translation.tests.buttonText}>
</ActionTestCard>
```



Here you should replace the header text, the link and the text, the link is set directly for the component, whereas the header and text has to be set in the translationNO.tsx file, located in magno-platform/src/components/locales/no/translationNO.tsx, in addition you need to update the Translation.tsx interface located in magno-platform/src/components/locales/Translation.tsx.

For Translation.tsx you should add two lines within tests

```
Add

headerNAME_OF_YOUR_TEST: string,
textNAME_OF_YOUR_TEST: string

to

tests: {
    headerMotion: string,
    textMotion: string,
    headerFixed: string,
    textFixed: string,
    headerRandom: string,
    textRandom: string,
    buttonText: string,
    tooltip: string,
},
```

For translationNO.tsx you should add two lines within tests

```
Add

headerNAME_OF_YOUR_TEST: "Name of your test",
textNAME_OF_YOUR_TEST: "Short description of your test"

to 

tests: {
    headerMotion: "Motion Test",
    textMotion: "Magno bevegelsestest er en test som gir en indikasjon på sannsynligheten for at eleven har dysleksi",
    headerFixed: "Form Fixed Test",
    textFixed: "Magno fiksertformtest er en kontrolltest som sjekker om eleven har problemer med synet som ikke skyldes dysleksi",
    headerRandom: "Form Random Test",
    textRandom: "Magno tilfeldigformtest er en kontrolltest som sjekker om eleven har problemer med synet som ikke skyldes dysleksi",
    buttonText: "Start test",
    tooltip: "Starter en test, du får opp et valg av elev før testen starter",
},
```

Alright, well done! You are now able to initiate the test from the front-end! The next step is to show the results in the Students screen.
First you want to add a risk average, or "critical line" which separates a good result from a bad one. For the motion test this is around 20-26.
You add this in Settings.tsx located in magno-platform/src/components/Settings.tsx, just add a key-value pair to the riskAverages dictionary. An example of how this can be done is
shown below, where you reaplce "my_test" and value. If your test has no such risk average, you can set the value to 0.

```
export const riskAverages = {"motion": 26, "form_fixed": 13, "form_random": 17, "my_test": value}
```

The final step is to add a ChartCard to Student.tsx which is located at magno-platform/src/components/views/Student.tsx, it looks like this for the motion test.

```
<ChartCard 
    header={props.translation.tests.headerMotion} 
    riskScores={props.store.studentStore.student.tests.motion_test}
    riskAverages={props.store.studentStore.riskAverages}
    translation={props.translation}
    >
</ChartCard>
```

For your test, you would add something like the following.

```
<ChartCard 
    header={props.translation.tests.headerNAME_OF_YOUR_TEST} 
    riskScores={props.store.studentStore.student.tests.KEY_USED_WHEN_POSTING_TEST_RESULT_TO_SERVER}
    riskAverages={props.store.studentStore.riskAverages}
    translation={props.translation}
    >
</ChartCard>
```

KEY_USED_WHEN_POSTING_TEST_RESULT_TO_SERVER might be difficult to understand, but I'll try to make it more clear. The server receives test results when a test is finished through an API endpoint. This endpoint requires 3 parameters, 

```
postScore: async function(req, res){
    const id = req.body.id;
    const test_type = req.body.test_type;
    const test_score = req.body.test_score;
```

The id represents the id of the student, the test_type is the essentially an identifier for the test, which you set yourself. For example, the motion test has a test_type of motion_test, the fixed form test has a test_type of fixed_form_test.
This is what you would replace with KEY_USED_WHEN_POSTING_TEST_RESULT_TO_SERVER.

The final change is a small one within the Chart.tsx file located at magno-platform/src/components. It includes simply adding another else if line, an example of how this should be done is shown below

```
function getAverageLine(){
    if (props.testType.includes("Motion")){
      return props.riskAverages["motion"]
    }
    else if (props.testType.includes("Form Fixed")){
      return props.riskAverages["form_fixed"]
    }
    else if (props.testType.includes("Form Random")){
      return props.riskAverages["form_random"]
    }
    else if (props.testType.includes("NAME_OF_YOUR_TEST")){
      return props.riskAverages["MY_TEST_NAME_AS_SET_IN_riskAverages"]
    }
    return 0;
  }
```

MY_TEST_NAME_AS_SET_IN_riskAverages would be the key used within the Settings.tsx file for adding a risk average line.

The test is now fully integrated, and the test will now be hosted with the server upon deployment. 

## Setting up the database
Follow the instructions available at https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/sql/create-cosmosdb-resources-portal, you can use mostly the default settings when setting up the cosmos database account. This is also included in Azure's free tier. 

After the account has been setup, you want to create a database and two containers for the database, and you can choose the names of the database and containers yourself. 

An example would be
magno-database for the database and magno-user-container and magno-student-container for the two containers. The containers should share throughput.

Yo should now be in the Data Explorer screen of the azure portal, on the left hand your have a navigation bar. Under settings, click Keys. Here you will find
your URI and Primary keys. Replace the following lines in db-account-config.js and db-student-config.js. You might also need to replace the databaseId and containerId based on the names you set for the two.

```
db-account-config.js

function db_account_config() {
    return ({
        endpoint: "YOUR COSMOS DB URI",
        key: "YOUR PRIVATE DATABASE KEY",
        databaseId: "magno-database",
        containerId: "magno-user-container",
        partitionKey: { kind: "Hash", paths: ["/id"] }
    })
}

db-student-config.js

function db_student_config() {
    return ({
        endpoint: "YOUR COSMOS DB URI",
        key: "YOUR PRIVATE DATABASE KEY",
        databaseId: "magno-database",
        containerId: "magno-student-container",
        partitionKey: { kind: "Hash", paths: ["/id"] }
    })
}
```

The database setup is now complete, well done!
